Always make those above you feel 
comfortably superior. 
In your desire to please and 
impress them, do not go too far
in displaying your talents or
you might accomplish the
oppositeâ€”inspire fear and 
insecurity. Make your masters 
appear more brilliant than they 
are and you will attain the 
heights of power.
